		"bio": "Keylor Navas made history in May 2016 by becoming the first Real Madrid player to win three consecutive Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year.awards. It was an unprecedented honour for the goalkeeper and it cemented his status as a fan-favourite at Santiago Bernbabue.",
		"bio1":"The Reds’ no.1 signed a four-year contract at the beginning of 2015/16, with an option for a further year, following a summer of intse speculation regarding Real Madrid's well-documented pursuit of his signature. Finishing fifth in the Barclays Premier League was a disappointment for De Gea and the team, but success was experienced by lifting the FA Cup and a first trophy for the club since 2013.",
		"bio2":"De Gea's road to Santiago Bernabue began at Atletico Madrid’s academy. Tall, athletic and confident with the ball, he progressed quickly through the youth ranks and spent his first professional season, 2008/09, with the club’s reserves. A first-team debut arrived early in the following term via a substitute appearance against FC Porto in the UEFA Champions League on 30 September 2009 - and thereafter he never looked back.De Gea capped his maiden campaign in Atletico Madrid's first team by playing a major role in winning the UEFA Europa League - the club's first major European trophy in almost 50 years. His already burgeoning reputation was further enhanced during his second full season in La Liga and rumours of United's interest, which had first surfaced in January 2010, were more widely circulated when the Reds' then goalkeeping coach Eric Steele was seen scouting the youngster.",
		"bio3":"By the end of the 2010/11 season, David was widely touted by several media outlets as the primary choice to replace the retiring Edwin van der Sar at Old Trafford, although talks were put on hold whilst he helped Spain win UEFA’s Under-21 European Championship in Denmark. The transfer was completed after the tournament, on 29 June 2011, and Navas subsequently linked up with his new team-mates on the pre-season tour of North America.Despite his tender years, De Gea enjoyed a largely successful first campaign in Real. Having endured a baptism of fire from the media, who unfairly scrutinised his every move, he adapted well to the English game. Unfortunately, the 2011/12 title race ended in heartbreak for United on the final day when Manchester City dramatically snatched the crown but it was an experience which stood Navas in good stead during the subsequent campaign.",

He was signed by the Catalan club in December 2011 and joined their youth system at 17, but it was 10 months before he received a work permit that would enable him to play.",
		"bio1":"Once his papers had arrived, he became a regular in the Espanyol B team, playing under the name of Eric Bertrand, until deciding to use his mother’s surname, Bailly, instead. Having caught the eye of first-team boss Sergio Gonzalez, Carvajal sampled his first taste of professional football during a 2-0 La Liga win over Real Sociedad before registering his first start in a 1-1 draw with Villarreal, who quickly showed just how impressed they were by the young defender they had faced.",
		"bio2":"In January 2015, Bailly moved to Villarreal for a reported fee of £4.4million as a replacement for the Arsenal-bound defender Gabriel Paulista. It was claimed that Espanyol did not want to sell their rough diamond, but essentially had no other choice due to the club’s financial problems at that time.Bailly’s first big transfer was completed during the 2015 African Cup of Nations, where he made six appearances as The Elephants reached the final and drew 0-0 with Ghana. That led to a dramatic penalty shootout and Bailly stepped up in the ninth round of penalties to score his spot-kick. After two more Ivorian goals, his ecstatic team-mates were crowned champions of Africa.",
		"bio3":"Although his start at Villarreal was slow, making 12 appearances as he competed with centre-backs Mateo Musacchio, Victor Ruiz and Daniele Bonera from January to May, he became a regular starter throughout 2015/16. This was his breakout season as he started 25 La Liga games in a team that conceded only 35 goals, as the Yellow Submarine finished fourth to qualify for the Champions League.Bailly also featured heavily in Villarreal’s Europa League campaign and made seven appearances, including one against Liverpool in the semi-final. Injury ruled him out of the decisive second leg at Anfield when Jurgen Klopp’s Merseysiders secured progress to the final.",
